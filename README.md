**GenAIversity Hackathon**

**Problem Statement:** When a group of students or curious minds get together online to study, brainstorm, or explore new topics, their sessions often turn into a chaotic cycle of Googling, fact-checking, and cross-verifying.

Someone says something , another person quickly opens ten tabs to confirm it , and before you know it, the flow of discussion is lost in a sea of search results.

Learning in groups should be collaborative and effortless, but instead, it often becomes fragmented, time-consuming, and mentally exhausting. Wouldn't it be amazing if the learning process could be smoother, smarter, and more interactive - without everyone juggling between browsers, notes, and AI tools?

**Solution**: Introducing AI-in-the-Room - your smart, friendly, always-on study companion!

Imagine an AI that joins your online meet just like any other participant - listening, understanding, and assisting your group in real time. It instantly answers your queries, clears misconceptions, explains tough concepts, and even helps summarize discussions - all without breaking your conversation flow.

**How is it better than existing systems?**

You type a query to any AI say GPT, but sometimes end up getting irrelevant, context unaware responses, So you end up explaining your idea to the AI. Instead, Our AI - in the room idea brings out a fresh concept of context aware scenario, where you no longer even have to explain your point of view to the AI, and just forget the messy prompts. JUST SPEAK WITH YOUR TEAM, AND GET THE JOB DONE.

**But that's not all! After your session:**

Auto-generated quizzes based on your discussion help you test what you've learned.

Smart summaries and notes capture every key point and insight, so no one misses out.

Minutes of the meeting are prepared automatically for easy review and reference.

No more switching between tabs, typing prompts, or losing focus. Just talk, learn, explore, and let the AI handle the rest. Because learning should feel like discovery , not labour!
